WEAR?,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3NASrEUoMe8/hqdefault.jpg,??XAStrAxBEauTYx,https://yt3.ggpht.com/qOMz1XmdoYlVhZ2Sfvjf0maDg_pflaHR-8xyK3e14NCa6sfFRGPIzFyGr1AVZDgMBUDMaSU7=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,hi guys how are y'all doing i hope you are very well indeed and thank you for joining me so you know me i just like to get straight into it but i'm just gonna be talking about makeup and everything related to makeup and skincare so if you like that keep watching so today i'm going to be uh reviewing and we're testing the la mer soft fluid longwear foundation yes i went and purchased this i couldn't resist myself i was in john lewis i just had to try it i mean i kind of went in there to buy the mac studio fx at like a third of the price of this i think it's like 30 pounds 33 pounds and i ended up working out with this i just was in the la mess in the mirror section i was putting on all the testers and i think i tried the powder foundation on my hand and i really really liked it i just thought just let me go for it you know it's not like i'm going to wear it every day for bloody the price well i paid for it so yeah i'm going to be wear testing this today i have kind of tried it once before and then just again somehow just got to the back of the drawer so i'm going to get a proper wear test today and i am going to be using a setting spray with this because when i did uh wear it last time i remember that it didn't last that long i was kind of disappointed so i am going to be wearing a setting spray with this this does have amazing skincare benefits like the cream as well you're getting the skincare benefits in this as well i just will put them up on the street screen because i don't have uh my laptop open and i also picked up uh the bear with me well then i picked this up yesterday the nyx bear with me concealer serum so everyone is talking about this everyone who tries it loves it so i have to try it i think i hope i got the right shade i should have got a shade lighter for concealer but it's fine the shade i do have is golden so yeah kind of looking a little bit like it's fine i'll make it work so i always need hydration on my face because i'm just that kind of person i have dry skin so i'm just going to be i'm trying to hit the bottom of the bottle pan on this because it doesn't really do anything it's the glossier future dew oil serum hybrid so it just gives more glow to the face but it gives me hydration and that's why i like it but i'm not gonna repurchase it it does absolutely nothing nothing for me um so yeah i'm just gonna apply this as my primer just because uh like i said i want hydration i'm not necessarily applying this for the glow because you know i don't really care about the hat okay so my face feels nice and hydrated so great okay so let's just go in with the foundations give it a shake because it is very watery as well so as you can see oh no it's not that watery okay i think i'm thinking of something else that is two pumps to the okay let's get a brush for this because i don't want to waste a drop on the sponge you have the charlotte tilbury brush and that was like my best my the one of the most well loved and well used brushes and i had it for like maybe six months and then it just started to like come away and break but that is like the best brush ever for blending in makeup but it doesn't last long it really doesn't last long and i was quite disappointed and i thought you know what i can't keep spending 33 pounds on one of these brushes every time they decide to kind of you know when they um i'll just give an example so like when the bristles start to come away uh come up so basically it's glued in here so it's like coming out so yeah i just kind of tried to work with it as long as i could and then in the end i just had to throw it away but it was such a it's such an amazing brush like i've never had a brush like it and it is first it's around 35 pounds 33 pounds so yeah definitely won't be repurchasing that in a hooray but i have a cheaper alternative for brushes because elf do some of the most amazing brushes i've ever used and my elf now is my go to for makeup brushes so i've just had so many uh they look like they did this color i don't even know if they still have these brushes but they just do amazing brushes so they have these from the electric mood collection they have these these are like the kylie cosmetics and yeah just check out elf brushes their sponges are amazing and also their brushes are as well they kind of last a little bit longer as well so let's apply a little bit more because it's kind of looking uh what's the word it's my face is looking uh perfect right now it's got a nice kind of healthy look to it and you can actually it feels okay as well considering it's got skin care benefits i believe that if you keep wearing this over time it's the equivalent to kind of using their skincare you know their cream it's really expensive it's like 300 pounds uh apparently it's equivalent to that to be honest i've been using a lot of drugstore well i use both i use high end and i use um drugstore but i was in boots kind of on a shopping spree uh and i kind of they had like that nivea q10 on sale i picked up that they had uh some l'oreal collagen and then and i picked up that and i picked up the boots boots have got their own brand now which is supposed to be amazing and it launched in america and i picked up the boots collagen it is a really good cream because i was using the olay collagen and the olay collagen is 35 pounds but the boots collagen i think does a better job and it's under 10 pounds but i've got it in the cell for eight or something like that but the only thing is my eyes are really sensitive to it so i can't put anyone in my eyes and my eyes react to it my eyes get watery i have to kind of shut my eyes i don't know i said i can't use that no more it's such a shame because it's such a good collagen cream so i will just stick with the nivea q10 i kind of use these creams in the morning uh i have noticed a difference i don't know if it is them creams because like i said i use high end as well i use keels i use a glow recipe but they're not bad you know you should mix and match and uh i think over time they will make it definitely make a difference to your to your skin because i definitely had aging kind of collagen loss on my face kind of the droopiness and that's kind of disappeared so second layer is on okay okay so let's go in with the nyx bear with me concealer serum i will put the claims on the screen as a again because i can't remember what they are and this is in the shade golden so yeah let's try this the foundation has actually not done a i've done a good job of actually covering my under eye so maybe i won't need too much of this but i can try this on a different day anyway so i have got quite uh i've got like two pumps on so i'm gonna spread it i think this is the perfect shade for me actually now it's it's not bad yeah okay i'm going to just use my finger and then yeah this is the good shape for me actually all right let's put some hair as well and i look like i don't know what i'm looking like right now but just let's kind of conceal all the edges right so let's blend with a sponge it blends so i mean it blended so easily and from the looks of things i've not looked in the mirror yet but from the looks of things it looks like it's done a pretty good job of covering up those uh dark circles yeah that is quite a good concealer it's basically it's covered amazingly well just from one one application and it is better than it reminds me it kind of looks like the nars radiant creamy concealer it's giving me that kind of eyes but it's covered better than the nars radiant creamy concealer so i do really really like that really good so i'm gonna pout it down and bronze and then i'm gonna come back and then we can kind of talk about what it's looking like okay so i completed my face i just set the under eye with the laura mercier and then the rest of the face i set with the bare minerals powder but can i just say like these uh give a little shout out to elf because these instant lift brow pencils by elf they're around three pounds they're under five pounds oh sometimes this comes out but i think that was my mistake but anyway these pencils are so cheap and so good i have it on my brows today they uh they kind of yeah you do have to give it a little bit like you have to work it a little bit but they're so worth the money they are they just they remind me they're kind of like i really liked a really light brow pencil like the charlotte tilbury but the charlotte talk was just a little bit easier to work with but these are really really good so like if you're on a budget like this is a really good one to try out i was impressed with this and i really really think it's worth every well it's only worth three quid but i think they're just really really good that's what i'm trying to say i just think they're amazing for the you know and so it's a bargain that's what i'm trying to say it's it's a bargain and they they're good they really are a good eye brow lip pencil so face is done and i know you're not gonna believe me but i feel like i have my face again when i was 18 years old this looks amazing it looked amazing when i just had bronzer on before i put blush on and highlighter i was wow this is amazing it's like i've had surgery to my face because i honestly my face just looks like an 18 year old again like it's just so smooth and it's just smooth and it just looks nice as well probably the skin care benefits in this however i'm gonna like i said i remember last time i tried it i was wowed but i remember it not lasting long that's the thing with this so i'm gonna apply my morphe luminous setting spray because i need the hydration so i am going to try today with a setting spray so yeah let's uh let me apply the setting spray and then we'll see if it lasts longer uh with a setting spray hopefully it should so i've turned the lighting down a little bit so you can kind of it kind of looks better now it's not got all that light so now you can see how smooth my face is and just how nice it looks it does yeah it's just it just is amazing and i just look so young yeah it's just a shame somebody needs to bring a drugstore version of this out because i cannot be paying 140 pounds for a foundation ever again that's not justified no way so yeah please someone make a drugstore version of this anyway let's we're test this now so the time is the time is 11 minutes past 12. so i'm gonna give this a good like nine hour wear eight nine hour wear uh yeah don't forget apply the setting spray it should last longer so i'm gonna do that now and i'll see you in a sec so it's 10 a.m now so i have give this a really long wear test i think 10 hours so okay so like i said last time i wore this i tried this it didn't last five hours i didn't have a setting spray on so i wore a setting spray today and it's kind of held up really well it the only thing is is that it doesn't look as nice as this morning so it's not looking too great it's not moved around uh kind of i can't you can't really see my natural oils so it's stayed in place because of the setting spray but it's not looking as nice as it did this morning uh so yeah it's just not really long wearing um skin still looks decent though with it on but i would want it to look not as nice as it as fresh and nice as when i first applied it all those hours ago for the price you know it's just not worth the money because it just doesn't last long it doesn't really hold up it and even though i can't really it's starting to bother me now that i'm going to take it off it starts to irritate my skin but it's been very light all day i feel i could barely feel anything on my skin but i think they're a skincare brand they should just stick to skincare i wonder what that powder foundation's like though it could be better but this one for me if you only if it's only going to look its best for like three four hours and then you're gonna you're gonna be asking for all like 130 pounds you know it's okay you've got you've gotta come better you've gotta perform better for that price you know um yeah so now it's just looking kind of dead but it stayed in place and it's still covering my imperfections but like when you fit you'll know what i mean if you apply it first and you're like oh my skin looks amazing and then like four hours later you're like oh it doesn't it's not looking that great uh anyway yeah so i won't be repurchasing this anyway that's a no from me but give it a try you may obviously have different opinions but as you can see skin still looks nice but it's just kind of looking a little bit dead if you understand what i mean anyway i'm gonna go so see you soon bye,
